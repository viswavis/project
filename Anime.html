<h2><u>NARUTO</u></h2>
 <p><b><u>Naruto</u></b> is a Japanese <mark>manga</mark> series written and illustrated by <mark>Masashi Kishimoto</mark>. It tells the story of <mark>Naruto Uzumaki</mark>, a young <mark>ninja</mark> who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two <mark>one-shot manga</mark> by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in <mark>Shueisha's</mark> monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
<br><br>
Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's <mark>shōnen manga</mark> magazine <mark>Weekly Shōnen Jump</mark> from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 <mark>tankōbon</mark> volumes. <mark>Viz Media</mark> licensed the manga for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital <mark>Weekly Shonen Jump</mark> magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an <mark>anime television series</mark> by <mark>Pierrot</mark> and <mark>Aniplex</mark>, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled <mark>Naruto: Shippuden</mark> and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 <mark>original video animations</mark> (OVAs). The franchise includes <mark>light novels</mark>, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto continues in <mark>Boruto</mark>, where Naruto's son <mark>Boruto Uzumaki</mark> creates his own ninja way instead of following his father's.
<br><br>
Naruto is one of the <mark>best-selling manga series</mark> of all time, having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on <mark>USA Today</mark> and <mark>The New York Times</mark> bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a <mark>Quill Award</mark> in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a <mark>coming-of-age</mark> theme, makes use of cultural references from <mark>Japanese mythology</mark> and <mark>Confucianism</mark>.</p>
